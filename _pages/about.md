My name is Juventino Saavedra. I am from Immokalee,FL. I chose this class because i wanted to expand and deepen my knowledge about computer systems and their softwares. AS a child it really intrigued and fascinated me how I would see hackers and cyber security people fight back against other cyber threats. what really captured my eyes was how they were able to read binary code and know whats going on. Seeing this growing up I always wanted an opportunity to get into the field, and now i am currently going to School to achieve some certifications. I am looking forward into a career as a cyber security analyst. i would love to integrate my new found knowledge and experiences into bringing real world solutions for the cyber world.
